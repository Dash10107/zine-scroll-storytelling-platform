## 🌟 What is Zinima?

Zinima is a **next-generation zine viewer** and immersive storytelling canvas — a platform that feels like flipping through a dream, gliding through poetry, or interacting with a visual short film.

Built with emotion, motion, and design in mind — it turns each digital zine into an experience that scrolls, flows, and breathes.

## 🧠 Core Philosophy

> 🖌️ *“We didn’t want another layout. We wanted a digital poem that responds to touch, scroll, and time.”*

Every pixel is placed with intention.  
Every scroll triggers an emotion.  
Every zine tells a story — in layers, in motion, in moments.
